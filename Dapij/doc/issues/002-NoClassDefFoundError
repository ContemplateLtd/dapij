[STATUS]
UNSOLVED

[ISSUE]
Static initialisations in system libraries (i.e. java.*) that use the 'new'
keyword cannot find agent's singleton classes which results in a
ClassDefNotFoundError.

The problem occurs, because system libraries are loaded by the bootstrap
classloader. The agent's singleton classes are loaded by a child classloader and
thus they are not seen by the bootstrap classloader and its classes.

[SOLUTION]
Append the agent JAR to the bootstrap classpath using:
-Xbootclasspath/a:/full/path/to/dapij-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

This way the static classes become truly global.

Possible issues with this approach?
