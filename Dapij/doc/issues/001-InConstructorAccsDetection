UNSOLVED

[ISSUE]
In-constructor access events for objects are generated before creation events for those objects.

[SOLUTION]
Considered options:
	* Edit message order so that creation messages appear before these access messages.
	* Discard in-constructor access messages. This is perhaps undesirable as the access events
		in question might prove useful in detecting leaked references from constructor to
		(other) threads.
