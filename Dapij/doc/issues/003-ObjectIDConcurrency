[STATUS]
UNSOLVED

[ISSUE]
Thread safety with the InstIdentifier singleton is currently achieved through a
synchronised getId() method that guarantees a consistent view of the map that
contains object IDs. This however introduces a performances bottleneck and
affects concurrency during execution of client program.

[SOLUTION]
Considered options:
	* reduce sync block.
