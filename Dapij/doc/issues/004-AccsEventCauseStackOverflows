[STATUS]
SOLVED (with workaround)

[ISSUE]
Access events cause event generation. Events are distributed to observers by
singleton classes which maintaining ArrayLists. When an event is created, the
singleton loops through the ArrayList to distribute the event. This internally
creates an Iterator object. The iterator objects generates events (either
its created with the 'new' keyword or because its .hasNext() method is called).
This, in turn, generates another event and so on. This leads to a
StackOverflow error.

This happens if the "java/util/ArrayList$Itr" class is instrumented.

A similar error happens whith the guava library responsible for maintaining the
concurrent map (in agent.InstIdentifier) that contains the object ids.For this
 reason, classes starting with "com/google/common/collect/" are not
instrumented.

[SOLUTION]
Do not instrument the "java/util/ArrayList$Itr".
Do not instrument classes from the "com/google/common/collect/" package.
