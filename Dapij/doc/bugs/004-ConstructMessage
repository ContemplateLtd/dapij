[BUG]
When attempting to construct a creation message, the agent breaks with
IllegalArgumentException when trying to update object identifier in
getId.

[SOLUTION]

The problem was caused by instrumenting the <clinit> function in two
system classes, java.lang.Long$LongCache and java.lang.reflect.Proxy.
Both classes are used in creating the messages to send, and so they
must be fully initialised before the first message is created.
As the <clinit> function is called when the class is being initialized, it
cannot be instrumented in this case.

This problem was solved by not instrumenting java.lang.Long.LongCache
and java.lang.reflect.Proxy.
