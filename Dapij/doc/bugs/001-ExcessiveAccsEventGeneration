[BUG]
Agent code generates an excessive amount of access messages. The reason for this
is that the transform/InstAccsVistr instruments the bytecode injected by
transform/InstCreatVistr. All method calls needed to produce a creation event
generate access events which are unnecessary. The goal of the agent is to
extract execution information from the user program and not the instrumenting
application itself.

[SOLUTION]
Swapped the order of InstCreatVistr and InstAccsVistr so that InstAccsVistr can
inject bytecode in the original user program bytecode whith the InstCreatVistr
code not being inserted yet. Even though this approach leads to instrumentation
of InstAccsVisitor's bytecode by InstCreatVisitor, the fix works -
InstAccsVisitor does not create new objects and InstCreatVisitor doesn't
generate new events.
