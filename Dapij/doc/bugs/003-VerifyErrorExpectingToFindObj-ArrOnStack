[BUG]
When class constructors are instrumented for field access detection, sometimes
the exception: java.lang.VerifyError: Expecting to find object/array on stack
is being thrown at runtime.

[SOLUTION]
Temporary solution: avoid instrumenting class constructors for field accesses
when the type of the reference being accessed is the class being instrumented.
