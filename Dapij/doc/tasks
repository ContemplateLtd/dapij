V - done
X - not yet done

	[1]. Architecture
NP			1.1	Implement a java server that streams *events to a network port
			V	* The server is created in a daemon thread that is started in the agent's premain method.
			V	* The premain method will block on an accept() call until a client connects (so that
					the user program doeasn't start until a client is ready to receive the messages).
			V	* The user thread will invoke server method calls that directly send the messages to
					the clients (relying on the OS network buffers) using send()**.
			V	* Add a ShutdownHook (a thread object) to Runtime that flushes the queues (perhaps
					by just calling close() on the connection) to guarantee that all messages are
					 delivered to the connected client.

				** Carefully choose the send function (to guarantee ordered messages).

			1.2	Implement a consumer API (e.g. using the Visitor pattern)
			1.3	Establish a protocol (message format) for the events

			*events - object creation, thread accesses to objects (class method invocation, filed access)

	[2]. Testing
			2.1	Test communication architecture & protocol

	[3]. Agent
			3.1	Implement object identification (either in map or in inserted field)
			3.2	Research the approach of adding a field to java.lang.Object
				- this is better as it is centralised, but might introduce other problems
			3.3	Cover the rest of the (currently not handled) cases for object creation
				which include (but may not be limited to):
				- create instances using reflection
				- create instances using deserialisation
				- deal with unknown instances (i.e. without known origin)

	[4]. Settings Singleton
			4.1 make it thread save in case needed, e.g.:
				- use a concurrent HashMap
				- use synchronised setters

	[5]. Proper logging
